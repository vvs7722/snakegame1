# Simple Snake Game (Python)

## About the Game:
This is a small snake game developed using Python. If the snake hits its own body or the wall, the game is over.

## Modules Used:
- **Turtle module:** Primarily used for creating the snake in this project.
- **Random module:** Utilized for generating food on the canvas.

## Note:
- The game runs only when both files are in the same folder.
- Designed for a 640 x 640 canvas.

## File Details:
- **sankegame:** The main file with instructions to run the snake game.
- **snake:** Contains the classes needed to run the game; these classes are imported into the main file.

Ensure that both files are in the same folder before running the game.
